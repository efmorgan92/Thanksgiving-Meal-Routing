# Thanksgiving-Meal-Routing
Each Thanksgiving, a Miami-based non-profit organization called Branches organizes the cooking, packaging, and delivery of over 3300 meals from five Methodist church partners to homes throughout Miami-Dade county. 

In 2015, I realized that staff were manually creating individual driving routes for volunteers to drop off 10-12 meals at a time. I created an Excel routing tool, and later an R Script, to automatically generate routes of 10-12 meals and 4-5 stops in similar locations. 

We continue to use this routing tool every year, spending only 5 minutes every year to create routes for the entire county!
